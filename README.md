## Module 08: Standard Template Library (STL) Basics
**Key Concepts**: Containers, iterators, and algorithms.
**Skills Acquired**:
- Utilizing STL containers like vector, list, and map.
- Applying STL algorithms for common operations like sorting and searching.
- Working with iterators for traversal and manipulation of container elements.

## Module 09: Advanced STL
**Key Concepts**: Advanced container usage and STL algorithms.
**Skills Acquired**:

## Learning Highlights
Through these modules, I have gained a strong foundation in:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
- Memory Management: Efficient use of stack and heap memory while avoiding leaks.
- Error Handling: Building error-resilient applications with exception handling.
- Generic Programming: Writing reusable and type-safe code using templates.
- STL Proficiency: Leveraging the power of STL for efficient problem-solving.
- This journey reflects not only an understanding of fundamental programming concepts but also an appreciation of C++ as a versatile and powerful language.
